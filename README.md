# INTERN-IIT-DHANBAD_MULTI-INPUT-FAULY-DETECTION
Developed a novel regression-based method for detecting parametric faults in multi-input analog circuits using polynomial modeling, validated on buck converter, lead-lag filter, and multiplier. Achieved robust fault detection under noise using Monte Carlo and V-Transform techniques.
